# MessageInTheWorld
MessageInTheWorld is my very first project, where you can point anywhere in the world and leave a message there. The project isn't something I created completelly, this concept is actually popular already, but i thought it was something i could manage to complete as my first time coding after few years of no practice. Besides the help with the idea itself, i also had the help of a teacher who used to gave me class back on 2018 which gave me part of the code (Specially the jquery part, which i wouldn't be able to do by myself at the point where i am today, thanks Rog√©rio!), but apart of this fraction, i made the other things and i am happy with what i've done with few days to learn js and few days to remember html, css and php.
